# ajax-project

An HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript web application for Rick and Morty fans

Reason for build

> I was looking for an API to use for a project but knew I wanted to have some fun with it. Being a huge rick and morty fan, I decided to use the Rick and Morty API to make a character app. Also, I had never built a game before and knew it would be a challenge so I decieded to incorporate a gaming aspect to it!
